# BAL (Branchpoint ALigner)

## Summary

Bal is a pipeline that finds branchpoints in introns.

The input of BAL is a set of reads coming from deep-sequencing data (FASTQ files) coming from lariats. Using HISAT and Bowtie2, and python scripts (in this repository) , BAL processes the reads and reports potential branchpoints.
